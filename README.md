# Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python
Let's walk through the provided code step by step, explaining how it works:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - At the beginning of the code, we import necessary libraries to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks.

2. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The code starts by loading a dataset from a CSV file. This dataset contains information about unemployment rates in India, with various columns such as 'Region,' 'Date,' 'Frequency,' 'Estimated Unemployment Rate (%),' 'Estimated Employed,' 'Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%),' and 'Area.'

3. **Label Encoding Categorical Features**:
   - The script employs a technique called "label encoding" to convert categorical variables into numerical values. Specifically, it encodes the 'Frequency' and 'Area' columns, which represent the frequency of data and the area (Rural or Urban).

4. **Feature Selection**:
   - After preprocessing, we select the relevant features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) for our analysis:
     - Independent variables (features):
       - 'Estimated Employed': This column represents the estimated number of employed individuals in a given region and time frame.
       - 'Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)': It represents the estimated labor participation rate, which indicates the percentage of people actively participating in the labor force.
       - 'Frequency': This categorical feature encodes the data frequency (e.g., 'Monthly').
       - 'Area': Another categorical feature that encodes the area as 'Rural' or 'Urban.'
     - Dependent variable (target):
       - 'Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)': This is our target variable, representing the estimated unemployment rate.

5. **Data Splitting**:
   - The dataset is split into a training set (X_train and y_train) and a testing set (X_test and y_test) using `train_test_split()`. This splitting is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model. In this code, 20% of the data is reserved for testing, and a random state is set to ensure reproducibility.

6. **Linear Regression Model**:
   - A linear regression model is created using `LinearRegression()`. Linear regression is chosen as the modeling technique because it's suitable for predicting numeric values.

7. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained using the training data, which includes the selected features (X_train) and the corresponding target variable (y_train). The training process involves learning the relationships between the features and the target variable.

8. **Model Evaluation**:
   - After training, the script evaluates the model's performance using two key metrics:

     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This metric quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual data. A lower MSE indicates better predictions.
     - **R-squared (R2)**: This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (unemployment rate) that's predictable from the independent variables. An R2 value close to 1 indicates a good fit.

9. **Print Metrics**:
   - The code prints the calculated MSE and R2 values to the console. These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of how well the model performs.

10. **Visualization**:

    - The code includes visualizations to help interpret the model's predictions and understand the relationships between variables:
      - A scatter plot of the predicted vs. actual unemployment rates provides a visual representation of how well the model's predictions align with the real data.
      - Two additional scatter plots show the actual and predicted unemployment rates concerning the estimated number of employed individuals and labor participation rates. These visualizations help visualize how the model's predictions align with the actual data.

This code provides a comprehensive analysis of unemployment rates in India, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, along with visual aids for better understanding the results.
